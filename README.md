A repository of the most common RL algorithms and example of their applications.

Here, I'd like to gather python code equivalents of the pseudo-code reported in "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, 2nd edition
by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto". The aim is not to create the most efficient algorithms but to be the most didactic and clear.
Showing all steps and hard-to-understand points.

Help, in the form of reviews, contributions, bug-reporting is greatly encouraged and appreciated.
